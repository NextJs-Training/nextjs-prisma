# NextJS Prisma Example

This example is a [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) todo app that uses
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) to store todos in Postgres.

```typescript
Prisma is a next-generation ORM that can be used to access a database in Node.js and TypeScript applications. In this guide, you'll learn how to implement a fullstack sample blogging application using the following technologies:
Next.js as the React framework
Next.js API routes for server-side API routes as the backend
Prisma as the ORM for migrations and database access
PostgreSQL as the database
NextAuth.js for authentication via GitHub (OAuth)
TypeScript as the programming language
Vercel for deployment
You'll take advantage of the flexible rendering capabilities of Next.js by using Static-Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) where it makes sense. At the end, you will deploy the app to Vercel.
```

## ‚ú® Features

- Prisma
- NextJS
- Postgres
- TypeScript
- Docker

## Prerequisites

To successfully finish this guide, you'll need:

- Node.js
- A PostgreSQL Database (set up a free PostgreSQL database on Heroku)
- A GitHub Account (to create an OAuth app)
- A Vercel Account (to deploy the app)

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

- [Provision a Postgres container on Railway](https://dev.new)
- Run the NextJS app `npm run dev` Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
- Connect to your Railway project with `railway link`
- Migrate the database `railway run yarn migrate:dev`

## üìù Notes

This app is a simple todo list where the data is persisted to Postgres. [Prisma
migrations](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate#prisma-migrate)
can be created with `railway run yarn migrate:dev` and deployed with `railway run yarn migrate:deploy`. The Prisma client can be regenerated with
`yarn generate`.

[swr](https://swr.vercel.app/) is used to fetch data on the client and perform optimistic updates.
